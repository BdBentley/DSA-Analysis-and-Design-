**What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**

The problem we were solving for this course mainly dealt with sorting algorithms. We were tasked in our projects to work with a company "ABCU" to print lists of computer science courses as well as printing out the title and prerequisites. The program had to sort the courses, and have a user be able to select a course and display a schedule based on their selection. This program also required us to make a menu to present the choices possible to the user.

**How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.**

I approached the problem by looking at the different sorting algorithms we were learning to work with. Then go about implementing the choice that I wanted to make. The sorting algorithms have different strengths and weaknesses, some run longer but allow for writing new data into the arrays and others run shorter such as vectors but you cannot add data into the list as easily.

**How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**

I find that a combination of youtube videos and our course material was helpful in getting me to pass any roadblocks. There is a lot of information out there available to us, and I learn better from videos. 

**How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**

I understand that I can utilize algorithms and other blocks of code and repurpose them for my own needs. This is a valuable skill to develop as a programmer since it can drastically cut down on the need to write custom code for every single project. For most problems, someone else has already done them. Now you have to implement it yourself. 

**How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**

I believe that being able to refactor your code and write it in a readable way is an invaluable skill. Not only to yourself when you might have to revisit a problem... but for future developers who might have to utilize your code themselves one day.
